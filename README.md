# FreeingOurselves
Android application that serves as a health guide for trans masculine people of color.

The Brown Boi Projectâ€™s Freeing Ourselves: A Guide to Health and Self-Love for Brown Bois is a beautifully constructed, deeply thoughtful, and powerfully political health guide by and for masculine of center/transgender/gender non-conforming people of color. 
The book is full of poetry; exquisite photography; safer sex information; adaptive device how-tos; nutritional, herbal and exercise advice; poignant personal stories; healthcare histories that centralize the experiences of people of color; exposures of class and racial injustices in healthcare and/or prison systems; and thorough analysis of the impact of oppressions as lived trauma experiences.

This book is a major resource to the community but it is now out of print and will not be reprinted anytime soon. This application is an attempt to preserve the knowledge found and share it with those that need it.

The application is a WIP and is currently not available on the Android store.
