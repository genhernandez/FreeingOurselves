<p>Launched in 2010, the <strong>Brown Boi Project</strong> works to build <strong>leadership</strong>, <strong>economic self sufficiency</strong>, and <strong>health</strong> of young masculine of center womyn, trans men, and queer/straight men of color - pipelining them into the social justice movement.</p>
<p>We are a diverse and broad community, driven by a commitment to racial justice, gender justice, and transforming our privilege of masculinity into a tool for <strong>social change</strong>.</p>
<p>We prioritize: </p>
<ul>
    <li>support that improves the lives of masculine of center womyn, queer, and trans people of color</li>
    <li>work that transforms the lives of women and girls</li>
    <li>work that introduces new alliances and tools for challenging racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia across our communities. </li>
</ul>
