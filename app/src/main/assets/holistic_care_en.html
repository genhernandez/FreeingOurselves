<h1>ACNE</h1>
<p>For transmen and others on testosterone, the first few years of "T" are a second puberty, so acne is probable. However, you need not just grin and bear this: there are things you can do. The skin and the liver are intimately connected, so in thinking about how to clear up acne, liver cleansing should also be included. See below for herbs to treat the liver. </p>
<h4><strong>Herbal Treatment</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tincture: </strong> Herbal medicine considers any ailment on the skin as connected to the function of the liver. Thus, a daily tincture of Milk Thistle, Burdock, Turmeric, Dandelion, and Yellow Dock can allow the body to process and balance hormones better and reduce acne. Take 1 dropperful 2x/day.</li>
    <li><strong>Poultice: </strong> A poultice using Chaparral, Dandelion Root, and Yellow Dock Root can be applied directly to the areas of skin with acne. To make a poultice, make a tea of the above herbs and then apply the herbs directly to the skin once it has somewhat cooled.</li>
    <li><strong>Steam: </strong> Lavender, Red Clover, and Strawberry leaves can be used as a steam for the face. Lavender kills germs and stimulates new cell growth. Caution: if acne is extensive or badly inflamed, steams aggravate the condition.</li>
    <li><strong>Oil: </strong> Tea tree oil is antibiotic and antiseptic. Dab full strength tea tree oil sparingly on blemishes 3 times per day, or addd 1 dropperful of tea tree oil to 1/4 cup warm water and pat on the area with a cotton ball.</li>
    <li><strong>Nutritional Changes: </strong> Eat fewer fatty and processed foods, any meats, milk products or eggs raised on hormones.</li>
</ul>

<h1>CANCER</h1>
<p>There is only one long-term study of transpeople on hormones, so the long-term effects are not fully known. However, in most materials concerning the effects of hormones, they warn against potential breast cancer (for both MTFs and FTMs), damage to the liver (for both MTFs and FTMs), and possible ovarian cancer. It is important to know that this is not just a ticking clock - there are many things we can do to ensure a healthy body and prevent cancer.</p>

<h1>HEART DISEASE</h1>
<p>Cisgender men are generally believed to have more heart disease, but actually they just get it earlier. once women go through menopause, their rates of heart disease are equal to that of men. So, what does this mean for transpeople on hormones? Transmen taking testosterone go through menopause, so generally their rate of heart disease would be equal to that of women after menopause or that of men. Testosterone is also known to increase LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. </p>
<p>An important and easy way to protect your heart is to make more food at home. Restaurants have more salt, cheaper oils, and more additives that will affect your body and your heart in the long term.</p>
<h4><strong>Herbal Treatment</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tincture: </strong> Red Clover, Motherwort, Hawthorne Berries, Milky Oat Seeds, and Cayenne will nourish the heart and cleanse the blood.</li>
    <li><strong>Nutritional changes: </strong> Increase the amount of antioxidants in your diet</li>
</ul>

<h1>HORMONE BALANCE</h1>
<p>One thing about taking exogenous hormones is that the body experiences a surge after the injection or gel, and then a depletion of the hormone just before the next dosage. We can use the herbs below to regulate the hormones, thereby allowing our bodies to have more consistency. </p>
<h4><strong>Herbal Treatment:</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li>Dong Quai will be useful for transmen and maybe transwomen. It could help treat the side effects of the hormones and balance out the treatment so we don't experience emotional extremes.</li>
    <li>Damiana and Licorice Root balance hormones and glandular function. Use Damniana as a tincture and chew on a Licorice Stick or put it in tea.</li>
</ul>

<h1>LIVER CARE WITH HORMONE USE</h1>
<p>It is imperative to take care of the liver as it processes extra hormones and continues to remove waste and toxins. Having exogenous hormones (those not made in one's own body) is more stress on the liver, giving it more work. It is best to think of how to care for the liver holistically - how to nourish it and have less for it to process. So, cutting back on alcohol, fatty food, substances/recreational drugs, and caffeine is generally helpful. </p>
<h4><strong>Herbal Treatment</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tincture: </strong> Milk Thistle, Turmeric, Oregon Graperoot. Milk Thistle is liver protective and regenerative, lowering fat deposits in the liver. Turmeric activates the liver function that regulates and balances hormones. Oregon Graperoot is liver cleansing and antibiotic. This is essential for those of us taking exogenous hormones.</li>
    <li><strong>Tea: </strong> Dandelion, Yellow Dock, and Burdock tea. This tea clears obstructions, aids the liver, and is anti-inflammatory. It will also help acne associated with testosterone. Simmer 2 tsp of roots in 2 cups of water for 20-60 minutes, strain and drink. </li>
    <li><strong>Nutritional Changes: </strong> Eat mushrooms! Maitake mushrooms protect the liver against cancer, and are T-cell stimulants. Shiitake mushrooms restore the liver and increase white blood cells in the body.</li>
</ul>

<h1>MIGRAINES</h1>
<p>Hormone treatment, both estrogen and testosterone, can cause migraines to occur more often if you already experience migraines. A migraine is a vascular headache that involves the excessive dilation or contraction of the brain's blood vessels. Migraines are usually accompanied by nause, vomiting, blurred vision, and tingling and numbness in the limbs that can last up to 18 hours. </p>
<h4><strong>Herbal Treatment</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tincture: </strong></li>Feverfew, Meadowsweet, White Willow bark, and Gingo Biloba. Feverfew helps alleviate pain, Meadowsweet and White Willow are anti-inflammatories, and Gingko Biloba helps increase cerebral circulation. Take one dropperful per hours while the headache lasts.
</ul>

<h1>POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME</h1>
<p>In my clinical work I have worked with many transmen who have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) and so I thought it appropriate to address it here. The principal features of PCOS are weight problems, lack of regular ovulation and/or menstruation, and excessive amounts or effects of androgenic (masculinizing) hormones. The symptoms and severity of the syndrome vary greatly, and often there is a relationship between Hypothyroidism, blood sugar metabolism, and PCOS. There are MANY causative factors including environmental/chemical stressors, poor diet (especially oxidized fats), lack of exercise, and high levels of emotional and psychological stress including that experienced due to separation from nature.</p>
<p>PCOS can be a difficult situation to treat with masculine-spectrum people because the manifestation of PCOS is more testosterone in the body, thus a more masculine appearance. The allopathic treatment usually lowers insulin levels, tries to restore fertility, treats acne, restores regular menstruation, and prevents endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. For some masculine of center people with PCOS, the more masculine appearance and irregular menstruation can be a blessing.</p>
<p>The insulin resistance associated with PCOS causes increased testosterone production at the ovaries. Thus, treating the insulin resistance is going to lead to decreased endogenous testosterone production, which, understandably, some transmen may not want. However, addressing the blood sugar irregularities are very important, considering the link to diabetes and cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>For transmen and those wanting a more masculine appearance, Iâ€™d generally recommend focusing on maintaining thyroid health and supporting blood sugar metabolism, reducing insulin resistance, and most importantly shifting the source and effects of various stressors through use of adaptogens and antioxidants/anti-inflammatories without focusing directly on shifting hormone profiles. This will maintain overall health while possibly leaving the hyperandrogenic picture slightly intact (though at some point this might shift as the rest of the endocrine system balances). This will be a trial and error process.</p>
<p>Thinking holistically, however, it is important to address blood sugar metabolism, nourish the uterus, attend to the stressors that created this condition in the body, and support the liver. Transmen with PCOS are likely to feel balanced and healthy with dietary changes, regular exercise, and herbs to nourish the liver.</p>
<h4><strong>Dietary Treatment: </strong></h4>
<p>Whole foods diet with lots of vegetables and a moderate amount of fruit, mostly berries. Avoid processed food.</p>
<ul>
    <li>High fiber diet - a lot of grains and vegetables</li>
    <li>Ground flax seeds - mix 1 tsp in yogurt, cereal, or juice daily </li>
    <li>1 tsp turmeric in food at least once per day (nourishes liver and is an anti-inflammatory)</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Herbal Treatment</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ayurvedic powder: </strong> Guggul and Ashwagandha. Guggul balances both the thyroid and blood sugar, and Ashwagandha nourishes the nervous system and has adaptogenic powers. 1 tsp in milk, juice, or food daily. </li>
    <li><strong>Tincture: </strong>Milk Thistle, Licorice, Turmeric, Cinnamon. Milk Thistle nourishes the liver, which processes all the hormones and filters toxins from our blood (environmental toxins can be one of the causes of PCOS). Licorice is an adaptogen and nourishes the adrenal glands. Turmeric supports the liver and is anti-inflammatory. Cinnamon provides insulin resistance. Take 1-2 droppersful twice daily. </li>
    <li><strong>Tea: </strong> American Ginseng, Cedar Berry, and Raspberry Leaf tea. Drink this tea daily to regulate blood sugar and nourish the pancreas and uterus. Steep 2 tsp of Ginseng and 1 tsp of Raspberry and Cedar Berry in 1 cup of water for 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>
