<p>For many of us seeking help when our bodies and spirits feel out of alignment, the usual advice is to follow one specific path. In contrast, we hope this book will give you LOTS of tools and resources to find alignment.</p>
<p>All of us are on a journey. It is time to pull the veil back and take a deeper look at our roots, our communities, and the unique interplay of body, mind, and spirit that make each of us whole. Too often, for masculine of center people of color, the conversation has been how to “fix” ourselves. <strong>That is not what this book is about. </strong></p>
<p>This is a book to help you think about alignment through our legacies as people of color — how we reclaim our bodies as trans and gender nonconforming people. This book is about you getting to be you — exactly who you are, however you feel whole, living fully in your body.</p>
