<h1>SOME THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT TESTOSTERONE: </h1>
<p>Almost all of the medical information and data about testosterone ("T") draws from samples of white people. Because there is little medical research done with Trans/gender nonconforming people of color as the focus, we are not sure what the long-term effects of testosterone might be for us.</p>

<p>Each method of taking testosterone has advantages and disadvantages, including cost ranging from $25-$200 per month, need for a HCP to administer some types of testosterone and safety for your liver, bones and skin.</p>

<p><strong>MORE TESTOSTERONE IS NOT BETTER!</strong> Taking too much testosterone will not make you transition faster, and it can cause serious damage to your liver.</p>

<h4>YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE "T" IF: </h4>
<ul>
    <li>You are pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
    <li>You have uncontrolled coronary artery disease</li>
    <li>You have active known androgen sensitive breast cancer</li>
    <li>You have active endometrial cancer </li>
</ul>
<h4>THESE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS COULD BE EXACERBATED BY TAKING "T": </h4>
<ul>
    <li>Androgen sensitive epilepsy</li>
    <li>Androgen insensitivity syndrome</li>
    <li>Migraines</li>
    <li>Severe obstructive sleep apnea</li>
    <li>Polycythermia (a high blood count- essentially, the blood becomes more concentrated due to an overproduction of red blood cells)</li>
    <li>Heart failure, kidney failure, or severe hypertension (high blood pressure)</li>
    <li>Active drug or alcohol abuse</li>
    <li>Smoke cigarettes</li>
    <li>Liver disease</li>
    <li>Severe acne</li>
    <li>Heart disease in yourself or your family</li>
    <li>High cholesterol</li>
    <li>Personal or significant family history of breast cancer (especially if known androgen-sensitive)</li>
    <li>History of uterine cancer</li>
    <li>Bleeding disorders (for injected testosterone only)</li>
    <li>History of blood clots</li>
    <li>History of violent behavior</li>
    <li>Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome</li>
</ul>
<h4>PERMANENT CHANGES CAUSED BY TESTOSTERONE</h4>
<h5>WILL HAPPEN:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Increased facial and body hair - not just on your face, chest and stomach-you may also get hairs on your back, buttocks, and even in your ears</li>
    <li>Deepened voice</li>
    <li>Enlargement of the clitoris to an average of 4-5 cm after 1-3 years</li></ul>
<h5>MAY HAPPEN: </h5>
<ul>
    <li>If you have not finished puberty, may have a growth spurt and closure of growth plates</li>
    <li>Male pattern baldness (may be partially treatable with certain medicines)</li>
    <li>Changes in your ovaries that make make it difficult or impossible for you to produce eggs or get pregnant even if you stop taking testosterone</li>
    <li>Possible but uncertain increases in risks of ovarian or uterine cancer</li>
    <li>Changes in your uterus (like fibroids) or ovaries (like cysts) that make hysterectomy (removal of uterus) and oophorectomy (removal of ovaries) more difficult if you eventually choose to have these surgeries. </li>
    <li>Rarely, benign or malignant liver tumors or other liver disease (mostly with transmen who take testosterone pills by mouth)</li>
    <li>Possible but uncertain increase risk of developing osteoporosis (thinning and weakening of bones) that may be worse after oophorectomy or if you stop taking testosterone</li>
</ul>
<h4>REVERSIBLE CHANGES </h4>
<ul>
    <li>Increased libido (sex drive) and changes in sexual behavior</li>
    <li>Increased muscle mass (especially upper body strength)</li>
    <li>Redistribution of fat to a more typical male pattern (to the stomach instead of the hips and thighs)</li>
    <li>Interference with other medications that you may take</li>
    <li>Increased sweat and changes in body odor</li>
    <li>Increased appetite, weight gain, and fluid retention</li>
    <li>Prominence of veins and coarser skin</li>
    <li>Acne of the face, back, and chest, especially in the first few years of treatment (which, if severe, may cause permanent scarring)</li>
    <li>Emotional changes (like difficulty accessing sadness or crying and increased anger and aggression)</li>
    <li>Worsening of blood cholesterol levels, which might increase your risks of heart attacks and strokes</li>
    <li>Increase in red blood cell count (which rarely, if severe and untreated, can make you more likely to have strokes, heart attacks, or blood clots)</li>
    <li>Stopping menstruation (periods). This may take several months or may be  immediate.</li>
    <li>Vaginal dryness and itching that may even occasionally cause pain with vaginal penetration</li>
</ul>
