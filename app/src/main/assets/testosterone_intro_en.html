<p>Transgender people on hormones are informed that they are at risk for various diseases, but typically all they are told to do is get their livers tested, blood tested, or not to smoke.</p>
<p>Hormones are a big part of his work because they are so complex and there are so many holistic treatments to augment, supplement, treat, and balance their effects. It is important to note that hormones act differently in different bodies. People experience different rates of skin softening or toughening, hair growth, etc.</p>
<h1>Testosterone</h1>
<p> Testosterone is used to make the body more masculine and is derived from male horse testosterone. It is available as an injectable gel, a path, or as an oral insert.</p>
<p>Testosterone effects include the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Permanent deepening of the voice, though not necessarily all the way down to an average male frequency</li>
    <li>Decreased fertility, as menstrual cycles become irregular and eventually stop</li>
    <li>Permanent clitoral enlargement</li>
    <li>Mild breast atrophy, but not substantial reduction in size</li>
    <li>Increased upper body strength with exercise</li>
    <li>Male-pattern facial and body hair growth</li>
    <li>Male-pattern baldness</li>
    <li>Increased sexual interest and arousal</li>
    <li>Redistribution of fat from hip toward waist</li>
