<h1>GENDER AFFIRMING SURGERY</h1>
<p>For some of us, surgery has been an important part of our journey to alignment. While the cost of surgery is a barrier for many folks, some MoC people of color are eligible for surgery for medical reasons through insurance. </p>

<p>For Cole, this surgery was life changing. Cole is masculine of center and lived with a large chest for most of her life. She fought her insurance company for over a year but was eventually able to get a breast reduction— with a surgeon with extensive experience in top surgery—covered by them. Her surgeon, Dr. Paul Wotowic, became an incredible ally as an HCP. After years of back pain, this medically necessary surgery liberated not only her body but her gendered spirit as well.</p>

<p>Many masculine of center people have found support from health care providers throguh community forums, social media networks, and word of mouth. The following is a list of gender affirming surgeries: </p>

<h4><strong>"Top Surgery" known as Chest Reconstruction Procedures</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong id = "subtitles">Mastectomy, Bilateral Periareolar:</strong> A small incision is made around the nipple, and breast tissue is removed or reduced. This is most successful for breasts that are A or B cup sizes.</li>
    <li><strong id = "subtitles">Mastectomy, Bilateral Complete with Nipple and Areola Reconstruction:</strong> Large incisions are made below the breasts and all of the breast tissue is removed. The nipple is then sewn back in place in a more typical male position, but all nipple sensation is lost.</li>
    <li><strong id = "subtitles">Mastectomy, Bilateral Complete with Nipple Pedicle:</strong> Same as above, except the nipple is left attached to nerve fibers so the end result may allow for sensation in the nipples.</li>
    <li><strong id = "subtitles">Mastectomy, Scar Revision:</strong> This can happen about 6 months after the initial surgery to help reduce the size and appearance of the scars. Complete removal of the scars is not possible.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Genital Reconstruction and Related Procedures</strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong id = "subtitles">Metoidioplasty: </strong>The clitoris is repositioned and extended to form a small penis. This may result in a penis that can gain erection naturally but can rarely be used for penetration.</li>
    <li><strong id = "subtitles">Metoidioplasty with Urethroplasty: </strong>Same as above, except the urethra is rerouted through the penis so the person can pee standing up.</li>
    <li><strong id = "subtitles">Abdominoplasty:</strong> This is a 'tummy tuck' that can make the penis appear larger.</li>
    <li><strong id = "subtitles">Free Flap Forearm Phalloplastya:</strong> A flap of skin from the forearm is used to create a penis with the urethra extending through it so standing to pee can be accomplished. This procedure can result in a larger penis, however, it is more complicated and expensive than metiplasty and requires repeat surgeries.</li>
    <li><strong id = "subtitles">Abdominal Pedicle Flap Phalloplasty:</strong> This is similar to the above forearm flap technique, except the skin is taken from the abdomen and waist. The scars from grafting the skin are less obvious than when taken from the forearm.</li>
    <li><strong id = "subtitles">Penile Erectile Prosthesis Implantation:</strong> Following Phalloplasty, this technique can be used to produce an erection in the penis and allow for penetration.</li>
    <li><strong id = "subtitles">Scrotoplasty with Insertion of Testicular Expanders:</strong> This procedure creates a male scrotum from the skin and soft tissue of the labia. Testicular expanders can be used to slowly enlarge the scrotum.</li>
    <li><strong id = "subtitles">Colpectomy (Vaginectomy):</strong> This procedure removes the vagina to create a more male appearing perineum. Severe blood loss is not uncommon with this surgery.</li>
    <li><strong id = "subtitles">Colpoplasty (Vaginoplasty):</strong> This procedure may come to replace Colpectomy because it is safer but results in the same effect- the vagina is closed and a male perineum is created. However, the vaginal and cervical tissue is then part of the abdomen, which makes screening for cancer and STIs more difficult.</li>
    <li><strong id = "subtitles">Colpocleisis:</strong> The lining of the vagina is removed and the muscles of the vagina are permanently fused together. This procedure has been done on elderly women with prolapsed uteri for many years and is relatively safe.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Other Transgender-Related Surgical Procedures: </strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong id = "subtitles">Hysterectomy with Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy </strong>: This surgery involves the removal of the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. It is important to talk with your surgeon before you have this procedure if you think you may want Phalloplasty or other genital reconstruction because this may change the plan to conduct the Hysterectomy vaginally or abdominally.</li>
    <li><strong id = "subtitles">Liposuction to Reduce Fat in Hips, Thighs, Buttocks: </strong>This is done to reduce famepatterned fat deposits around the hips, thighs, and buttocks.</li>
