Additionally, we have social get-togethers, club parties, outreach to New England and New York gender organizations, and a speakers bureau. Smoking is not allowed during our meeting. Local ordinances restrict smoking to outside the building. During the course of the meeting, we enjoy a half hour break, during which people are encouraged to get to know one another and to help themselves to food and beverages. Please feel free to bring food and/or beverages to share with our group<br>.Security: We are a peer support group, not a dating service or an instant source of new best friends.

These services include: Mental Health <br>Care Primary<br> Medical Care<br> Surgical Care<br> Speech/Language Therapy <br>Support Groups for Family and Friends<br>Our goal is to provide the transgender person and their family members with the information, care, and resources needed to make transition as comfortable and convenient as possible.<br><br>Mental Health Care<br>The program has a team of mental health professionals including social workers, clinical psychologists, and master’s level counselors. These providers have a special interest and experience in working with gender-variant and transgender individuals.Once a patient has completed the enrollment process, they will be referred to one of the CGSP mental health providers. This therapist will become their advocate throughout transition, and will serve as the primary contact for medical, surgical, or other special referrals.Our clinical psychologists also serve as second-opinion providers for CGSP mental health team members as well as non-CGSP mental health providers.If a patient comes to CGSP already having a mental health provider, we’ll assess where the patient is in the process and determine how we can help facilitate their transition.<br>Primary Care<br>The UMHS-CGSP provides primary medical care to gender-variant and transgender patients in a welcoming and affirming environment. Services include: <br>Health education <br>Health risk assessment <br>Care of chronic conditions (such as hypertension or diabetes) <br>Gynecology <br>Dermatology Pre- and post- operative medical and sexual care <br>If referrals to specialty providers are needed, patients will be referred to physicians familiar with the needs of gender-variant individuals.<br>Speech Language Therapy<br>The special problem of achieving gender appropriate speech and voice is a concern of great importance to many transgendered individuals. As is the case with any person, when speech interferes with one's attempts to effectively communicate, or when the quality of one's speech or voice calls negative attention to the speaker, then speech and language therapy may be warranted.With gender-variant patients, the goals of Speech Language Therapy include: Voice modification (e.g. pitch, intonation, quality) Speech/articulation (e.g. manner of speech sound production) Language (e.g. vocabulary usage) Non-verbal communication (e.g. conversational style, social skills, body language, gesture, facial expression)Participation in Speech Therapy begins with an initial evaluation, during which each client's individual speech/voice goals are established. Follow-up individual sessions are aimed at helping clients to learn the specific techniques needed to meet their objectives. Depending on enrollment, scheduling, and client needs, group sessions may also be available to clients. Group therapy goals would typically focus on practice, carryover and generalization of newly learned verbal and non-verbal skills, as well as to provide opportunities for social skills exploration, role-playing, and peer support and feedback."<br> http://www.uofmhealth.org/medical-services/transgender-medical-services]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA["Counseling Services<br><br>The Gender Identity Center offers low cost counseling services for gender variant individuals, couples, and loved ones. Our counselors are pro bono therapists and clinical interns from local universities who are professionally trained to help you in your transition. Counselors can assist you in your personal journey of gender exploration and discovery by working with you to accomplish your goals for counseling, providing emotional support, and by serving as advocates within the community.<br><br>Letters for SRS, FFS, and HRT are available after assessment and consultation with your counselor. Because the WPATH Standards of Care no longer require letters for hormone therapy from a qualified therapist, our staff maintains a viewpoint that our role is to help clients manage the social and emotional concerns that arise during the transition process, and therefore letters are provided with some discretion. If you feel unsatisfied with the pace of therapeutic services, we can provide you with referral to qualified physicians that use an "informed consent" model of practice, as opposed to those who require recommendation letters. We aim to establish collaborative care, providing therapeutic support and advocacy while not claiming to act from medical expertise.<br><br>The first step to begin counseling is picking up the phone! We will happily schedule an intake session with you. When you come in for your session, you will be greeted by a counselor and escorted into the counseling room. The first session, called the “intake,” will allow us to get a picture of your needs and gain information about your current situation so that we can then match you with the most appropriate clinician. We will gather a variety of information at this time, such as your work and housing situation or social supports. Your intake clinician may not be your permanent counselor. Counselors and clients are matched based on the client’s needs and availability. We are open six days a week, but do not offer 24 hour services, on-call therapists, or emergency services through the Gender Identity Center.<br><br>The cost of services is $25 for the first intake session, and $15 per additional session. However, sliding scale negotiation is available for clients who are unable to afford full cost services at this time.<br><br>If you are interested in starting counseling at the Gender Identity Center of Colorado, please give us a call at 303-202-6466! Oftentimes the hardest step of beginning the therapeutic process is walking through the door. We are eager to welcome you inside in order to assist and support you through this exciting journey!"<br>Also offers:<br>Internships<br>Drop-in Hours (9am-9pm 7 days a week)<br>Pet Assisted Therapy with an adorable dog]]></description>

        <name>Toronto, ON: The Transgender Youth Clinic @ The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids)</name>
        <description><![CDATA["Beginning in October 2013, transgender teens in the Greater Toronto Area will have better access to healthcare services with the opening of the Transgender Youth Clinic at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids).<br><br>“Transgender teens in the GTA are lacking the timely medical support required to manage their gender dysphoria. The Transgender Youth Clinic at SickKids will fill this important gap by providing medical care, and aims to minimize negative medical and psychosocial outcomes and maximize the potential for a healthy and happy future,” says Dr. Joey Bonifacio, Physician in Adolescent Medicine and lead of the Transgender Youth Clinic at SickKids.  <br><br>Transgender individuals are those whose gender identity (self-identified as male, female, both, or neither) do not match their anatomical sex. Gender dysphoria is the extreme discomfort experienced by such individuals. If left unmanaged, it could lead to negative consequences such as mental health concerns and behavioural risks.<br><br>While the prevalence of gender dysphoria is uncommon, increased openness and acceptance of sexual and gender identity minorities has resulted in more adolescents and young adults identifying as transgender (or trans) at a younger age. The medical support offered through the Transgender Youth Clinic at SickKids includes consultations with an interdisciplinary team who provide ongoing assessments to ensure patients are receiving appropriate counselling, and in some cases hormone therapy to prevent pubertal changes.<br><br>“Not all transgender adolescents will choose to transition to the opposite gender when they are adults. However, for adolescents who are unsure about their gender and experience serious mental health concerns due to pubertal changes, hormone therapy can reduce depression and anxiety caused by these changes in the body,” says Bonifacio.<br><br>A study of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth found that 15 per cent met the criteria for major depression. Another recent study found that close to 50 per cent of Ontarian transgender youth aged 16 to 24 had seriously considered suicide and 19 per cent had attempted suicide. “This is likely a reflection of the multiple psychosocial problems faced by transgender adolescents such as family and peer rejection, harassment, trauma, abuse, inadequate housing, and lack of financial support,” says Bonifacio.<br><br>He adds that some transgender youth may try to inappropriately access cross-sex hormones and engage in behaviours like self-mutilation, putting their physical health directly at risk. “These mental health and medical problems are likely compounded by a delay in care, so our hope is that the establishment of the Transgender Youth Clinic will allow for timely access to this much-needed care,” says Bonifacio.<br><br>There are two mental health clinics providing the diagnosis of gender dysphoria in Toronto but there are currently no clinics devoted towards meeting the medical care needs of transgender adolescents. While there are established transgender adolescent clinics in, and affiliated with tertiary paediatric hospitals in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Montreal, Ottawa, and Halifax, there are none in Toronto.<br><br>The current team at SickKids includes staff physicians in Adolescent Medicine and Endocrinology, a nurse practitioner, a nurse, and social worker and liaise with numerous children’s mental health organizations.<br><br>The Transgender Youth Clinic will include both educational and research roles and will offer valuable training to other medical health care professionals. The link between research, learning and care is aligned with SickKids values in providing compassionate care, advancing scientific and clinical knowledge and preparing the next generation of leaders in child health."]]></description>

Hormones are given as oral or injected medications.Therapy is based on care standard guidelines established by The Endocrine Society called Endocrine Treatment of Transsexual Persons. The guidelines were developed by a task force of content experts and co-sponsored by the European Society of Endocrinology, European Society of Pediatric Endocrinology, Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. The guidelines address treatment of adolescents, hormonal therapy for transsexual adults, long-term care and sex re-assignment surgery."<br>http://www.froedtert.com/endocrinology/t]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA["he Gender Identity Clinic subscribes to the core criteria for Hormone Therapy (HT) and Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS) outlined in the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), Standards of Care, 2011. The International Standards of Care specify that these represent minimum standards and how they are applied can vary by professionals and by setting. Other aspects of our criteria, for example, reflect requirements to access OHIP funding.<br><br>Given our lengthy waitlist, we are encouraging family doctors, as much as possible, to take up the work of hormone therapy evaluations. Please see our Open Letter to Family Doctors link which offers related resources.<br><br>There are a number of relevant factors in any approval, all of which are necessary components in an approval, and none of which are alone sufficient for an approval. Some of the factors are related to eligibility, and other factors are related to readiness criteria.<br><br>Core aspects of the criteria for hormone therapy approvals include:<br><br>    You have received a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria<br>    You have given this due thought and made appropriate disclosures and arrangements. This can include things like having considered implications for fertility, and having “come out” to important people in your life.<br>    Any mental health or substance use issues are well-controlled.<br>    You are knowledgeable about the intervention(s) and their risks.<br><br>Core aspects of the criteria for surgery are:<br><br>    You are 18.<br>    You have received a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria.<br>    You have given this due thought and made appropriate disclosures and arrangements. This can include things like having considered implications for fertility (where relevant), and having “come out” to important people in your life.<br>    Except in the case of chest surgery, you have been on hormones continuously for one year.<br>    Except in the case of chest surgery or hysterectomy where there is no set expectation, you have completed a continuous Gender Role Experience (or GRE). The GRE is multidimensional and includes documented activity of your community living in a role congruent with your identity. This activity should be commensurate with your abilities, and also demonstrate a social experience of good breadth and quality. A good GRE provides a reasonable set of social experiences necessary as part of informed consent, as well as time to adjust and adapt to the challenges within it in order to function successfully. For most people, this will continue to be found in employment, school studies and voluntarism, or any combination of these. For others we may take the approach of an individually-tailored plan as to the nature and quality of the GRE. Clients become eligible for genital sex reassignment surgery after one year of documented GRE, recently completed. An identity-congruent legal name change is strongly recommended. <br>    Any mental health or substance use issues are well-controlled.<br>    You are knowledgeable about the intervention(s) and their risks, and have a good aftercare plan in place."<br><br>http://www.camh.ca/en/hospital/care_program_and_services/hospital_services/Pages/gid_criteria_hormone_surgery.aspx]]></description>
