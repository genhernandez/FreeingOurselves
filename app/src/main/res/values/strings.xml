    <!-- About -->
    <string name="about">Launched in 2010, the Brown Boi Project works to build leadership,
        economic self sufficiency, and health of young masculine of center womyn, trans men,
        and queer/straight men of color - pipelining them into the social justice movement.
        We are a diverse and broad community, driven by a commitment to racial justice,
        gender justice, and transforming our privilege of masculinity into a tool for social change.
        We prioritize support that improves the lives of masculine of center womyn, queer,
        and trans people of people of color; work that transforms the lives of women and girls;
        and introduces new alliances and tools for challenging racism, sexism, homophobia,
        and transphobia across our communities.</string>
